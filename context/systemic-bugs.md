# Systemic Bug Patterns — Architectural Issue Catalog

> Recurring bug classes rooted in architectural mismatches between N64 assumptions and the PC port. These aren't individual bugs — they're *categories* that produce bugs wherever the pattern exists. Use this as an audit checklist.

> For one-off bugs, see [bugs.md](bugs.md).

## SP-1: MAX_PLAYERS Array Indexed by Bot mpindex

**Severity**: CRITICAL — ACCESS_VIOLATION crash
**Root cause**: Arrays sized `MAX_PLAYERS` (8) indexed with bot mpindex values (8–31). N64 had max ~12 entities; PC has up to 36 (MAX_MPCHRS).

**Key arrays affected**:
- `g_Menus[MAX_PLAYERS]`, `g_AmMenus[MAX_PLAYERS]` (bss.h)
- `g_MpSelectedPlayersForStats[MAX_PLAYERS]` (bss.h)
- `g_BgunAudioHandles[MAX_PLAYERS]`, `g_LaserSights[MAX_PLAYERS]` (bss.h)
- `g_PlayerExtCfg[MAX_PLAYERS]` (data.h)
- `g_FileLists[MAX_PLAYERS]` (data.h)

**Fix strategy**: Bounds-check and SKIP for bots — never alias via modulo.

**Files fixed (S15)**: ingame.c, mplayer.c, bondview.c, menutick.c
**Files still needing audit**: activemenu.c:71, player.c:5094, endscreen.c:1704/1806, menu.c:5590/5972/6280

**Search command**: `grep -rn 'g_MpPlayerNum\|% MAX_PLAYERS\|AVOID_UB' src/`

## SP-2: Modulo-Hack Bounds "Fix" (AVOID_UB)

**Severity**: HIGH — silent data corruption
**Root cause**: `% MAX_PLAYERS` used as "bounds clamp" silently aliases bot data onto wrong player. Bot index 11 → index 3 (`11 % 8 = 3`), corrupting player 3's state.

**Correct approach**: Bounds-check and skip, not modulo-alias.

**Files known affected**: bondview.c (fixed S15), mplayer.c:704/3754

**Search command**: `grep -rn 'AVOID_UB\|% MAX_PLAYERS\|% MAX_LOCAL' src/`

---

## SP-3: g_PlayerExtCfg Beyond MAX_LOCAL_PLAYERS

**Severity**: MEDIUM — reads garbage for remote/bot players
**Root cause**: `g_PlayerExtCfg[MAX_PLAYERS]` meaningful only for local players (indices 0–3). Code indexes with values 4–7.

**Correct approach**: Use `MAX_LOCAL_PLAYERS` (4) as bound, or `PLAYER_EXTCFG()` macro (masks with `& 3`).

**Files known**: mplayer.c:704/3754, bondwalk.c:908

## SP-4: Hardcoded Stage Index Domains

**Severity**: HIGH — OOB crashes with mod stages
**Root cause**: Three index domains entangled: stage table (87 entries), solo stages (21 entries), best times (21 entries). Mod stages get valid stage table indices (61–86) but are OOB for solo stages and best times.

**Status**: Phase 1 safety net complete (S23) — bounds checks at all known access points. Phase 2 (dynamic stage table) and Phase 3 (index domain separation with `soloStageGetIndex()`) designed, not coded.

**Guard added**: `if (stageindex >= NUM_SOLOSTAGES) return` in cheats.c, endscreen.c, training.c, mainmenu.c

**Constraint note**: See [constraints.md](constraints.md) — Index Domain Warning section.

## SP-5: Large Stack-Allocated Buffers

**Severity**: MEDIUM — stack overflow risk on PC threads
**Root cause**: N64 had single known stack. PC threads default to 1MB. Large buffers in deep call chains can overflow.

**Known dangerous buffers**: See [memory-modernization.md](memory-modernization.md) Phase M2.

---

## SP-6: Magic Number Allocation Sizes

**Severity**: LOW→MEDIUM — readability + silent breakage when constants change
**Root cause**: Bare hex/decimal literals for buffer sizes. When limits change (MAX_BOTS 8→24), hardcoded sizes don't update.

**Status**: Phase M1 of memory modernization — `memsizes.h` created with 30+ named constants. 8 high-priority files converted. ~100 ALIGN16 replacements remaining.

**Search command**: `grep -rn 'mempAlloc(0x\|mempAlloc([0-9]' src/`

## How to Use

- Before starting any work that touches arrays, memory allocation, or stage indexing, scan this file for relevant patterns.
- When fixing a one-off bug, check if it's an instance of a pattern here. If so, do a propagation check (§3.6) on all files listed under that pattern.
- When discovering a new pattern class, add it here with severity, root cause, known sites, and search command.
